My learning for this project was to improve my seperations of concerns principles when developing a website.

## Optimizations

The big thing to optimize when creating this code is to start utilizing more up to date syntax when creating the HTML content. I find myself defaulting to using "div" a lot of the times
when a section should have been used.  As best practice, I will try to refactor the HTML code to make it more update to current standards and developer friendly as well for others to code review. 

## Lessons Learned:

Seperation of Concerns within HTML sections. Using proper tags will help make the code readable for debugging purposes as well as developer friendly for other devs to review the code.
